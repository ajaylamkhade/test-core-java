 * prototypes design pattern allows you to create objects by cloning an existing object instead
 * of creating a new object from scratch.
 * This pattern is used when the process of object creation is costly.
 * when cloning, the newly copied object contains the same characteristics as its source object.
 * After cloning, we can change the values of the new objectâ€™s properties as required.
 * This pattern comes under a creational pattern.
